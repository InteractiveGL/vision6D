"""
PyTorch3D (include differentiable rendering) uses a left-handed coordinate system for camera and object positioning. In this system:
The X-axis extends to the left.
The Y-axis extends upward.
The Z-axis extends into the screen (away from the viewer).

That is why we define our coordinate system to be left-handed coordinate system, and to be consistent with pytorch3d.

User matrix in Vision6D is concatenated with the actorâ€™s internal transformation that is implicitly created when the actor is created. 
This affects the actor/rendering only, not the input data itself.
The user matrix is the last transformation applied to the actor before rendering.

^Note that the user matrix (4 by 4) is the RT of the object, and to find the RT of the camera itself, we need to inverse the R (R.t()) of the provided user matrix.
